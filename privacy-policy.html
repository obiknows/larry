This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how LAWTRADES, INC (“LawTrades” “we” or “us”) and its related companies (“Company”) collect, use and share personal information of consumer users of this website, www.lawtrades.com (the “Site”). This Policy also applies to any of our other websites that post this Policy. This Policy does not apply to websites that post different statements.<br /><br /><strong>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>As used herein, the term "personal information" generally means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as user's name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number) or that is associated with an identifiable person (such as demographic information or information about a person's activities when such information is linked to personally identifying information). However, personal information does not include, and this policy does not cover, any publicly available information and public records about professionals, including without limitation information obtained from licensing authorities, associations, accrediting bodies, courts, law enforcement agencies, and websites that are available to the public. Personal information also does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or categories of Site users, from which any personal information has been removed. We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including to help us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to user desires. This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.<br /><br /><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong>Personal information may be collected from you in a number of ways when you visit LawTrades or use the various services and activities available on our Site.
